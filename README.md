# Chip8-Emulator

## Development
Clone down this repo and run npm install to install the dependencies.

Make changes.

Then in the root of the repo, run:
1. `tsc`
2. `node ./dist/index.js`

## Goals
- I want to focus on using Test Driven Development (TDD) to build out this project to learn how to acutally do it and how I feel about it.
- I want to have the chip 8 library be as portable as possible and be able to run it anyway that can run javascript. (React, Electron, Terminal)
